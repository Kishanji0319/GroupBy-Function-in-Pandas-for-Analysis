# GroupBy Function in Pandas for Analysis
 The groupby function in Pandas is a powerful tool for data analysis, allowing you to split your data into groups based on certain criteria, apply functions to each group independently, and then combine the results. This process is often referred to as “split-apply-combine.
 
**Key Steps in groupby:**
 ->Split: Divide the data into groups based on the values in one or more columns.\n
 ->Apply: Apply a function to each group independently. This could be an aggregation (e.g., sum, mean), transformation, or filtering.\n
 ->Combine: Combine the results into a new DataFrame.\n

Applications:
Summarizing Data: Quickly calculate summary statistics like mean, sum, count, etc., for different groups.
Data Transformation: Apply custom functions to transform data within each group.
Filtering Data: Filter groups based on certain criteria.
